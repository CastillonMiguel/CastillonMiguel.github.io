Latex to pdf with github action
===============================

This `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CastillonMiguel/Latex2pdf_with_GithubAction>`_ provides an example LaTeX project that demonstrates the use of sections, images, tables, mathematical equations, and a bibliography. The project is automatically compiled into a PDF using GitHub Actions, making it easy to generate the final document directly from the repository.
